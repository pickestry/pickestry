Beware! There is no escaping the stellar fury of this system.

Its discovery was announced in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2023, researchers using NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope saw the planet being blasted by its star and puffing off the hydrogen in its atmosphere. More observations revealed that the planet seemed to be &#39;&#39;hiccuping.&#39;&#39; On one orbit, the planet was seen puffing up, during another, no such atmospheric loss was noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;ve never seen atmospheric escape go from completely not detectable to very detectable over such a short period when a planet passes in front of its star,&quot; said Keighley Rockcliffe of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. &quot;We were really expecting something very predictable, repeatable. But it turned out to be weird. When I first saw this, I thought &#39;That can&#39;t be right.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n"
